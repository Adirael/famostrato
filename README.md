You can see it in action at <http://famostrato.cosas.tecnilogica.com/> and read about it (in Spanish) at our blog: [Famostrato: personajes hist√≥ricos de las calles de Madrid](http://blog.tecnilogica.com/2015/04/22/famostrato-personajes-historicos-de-las-calles-de-madrid/)

Please bear in mind:

* Famostrato is a side project
* Famostrato is provided 'as is'
* Famostrato is a quick and dirty hack
* Famostrato is a humble proof of concept
* Go home Famostrato, you're drunk

If you still feel adventurous, just some advice: please, complete `secret.js` with your [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/sessions/new) credentials.

There is no documentation available. We aim to clean up the code and add some serious documentation. Let's hope...
